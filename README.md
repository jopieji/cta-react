# CTA Tracker using React
### Jake Opie

---

### Overview
This project is going to be a web app that tracks a user's selected CTA trains and buses, and provides browser notifications to let the
user know when their train or bus is coming. This app will hopefully be useful to someone, as I am not sure there is a browser-based CTA
tracker out right now. The browser notifications will be perfect for students, who so often have many many tabs open and might forget to
keep an eye on when their bus/train might show up!

### Technology
The technologies I am using React, Nodejs, the CTA Train Tracker API, and maybe MongoDB. I might just use local storage to prevent extra complication, but I will see what is most intuitive.

### Future Plans
I might add the CTA Bus Tracker API once I get an MVP up and running. Again, this is subject to change, and I will probably begin working on a Native version before I expand the Web App too much. Making a Native version will help prepare me for my upcoming internship and will work around the notification issue I ran into using Django.
