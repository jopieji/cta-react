# CTA Tracker using React
### Jake Opie

### Overview
This project is going to be a web app that tracks a user's selected CTA trains and buses, and provides browser notifications to let the user know when their train or bus is coming. This app will hopefully be useful to someone, as I am not sure there is a browser-based CTA tracker out right now. The browser notifications will be perfect for students, who so often have many many tabs open and might forget to keep an eye on when their bus/train might show up!

### Using for Yourself
Right now, this app is not deployed. Once I get an MVP up and running, I will deploy the app so everyone can use it easily.

If you want to use it in its current form, you can sign up for the CTA Train Tracker API and get a developer key pretty easily. I was able to get mine in about a day, so it won't be too much of a hassle. Just make sure you put your key in the URL on the Stop.js file, and everything should work fine! 

If there is an issue with "Access-Control-Allow-Origin", you can install the CORS browser extension for Chrome or Edge for the app to work.

### Technology
The technologies I am using React, Nodejs, the CTA Train Tracker API, and maybe MongoDB. I might just use local storage to prevent extra complication, but I will see what is most intuitive.

I might try out some no-code tools to see what they are like. No-code tools would speed up development, but might also take away from my learning, so I am a little split on this decision.

### Future Plans
I might add the CTA Bus Tracker API once I get an MVP up and running. Again, this is subject to change, and I will probably begin working on a Native version before I expand the Web App too much. Making a Native version will help prepare me for my upcoming internship and will work around the notification issue I ran into using Django.

I might use Jotform or Bravo Studio to help make a mobile version of this app. I want to nail down using React before I dive into React Native.
